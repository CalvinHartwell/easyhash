Easy Hash - Calvin Hartwell 
=============================

After having worked with several web apis (REST and SOAP) I decided to write this small application to help generate hashes.

It is very typical for a web API to request a hash of a user password or username, or a combination of the two for authentication purposes. 

The application will generate hashes using the following functions: MD5, SHA1, SHA245, SHA318 and SHA512

Base64 encoding is also supported, but the new SHA3 keccak function has not been included in this initial version. 

The application is built in Visual Studio 2013 Express and is being distributed as free software with no warranty. 

The software is licensed under the GPLv2 and the license can be found in the file called COPYING
